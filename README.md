# etch-a-sketch
A simple program designed to let you draw a sketch on a webpage!

I'm quite proud of how this one turned out - it took some time.
I did have to borrow a bit of code from user Silende87's working example in order to get the clear grid function working, but other than that, it was mainly my experimenting and research that led me to the working copy I've published.

The biggest challenge in this for me was to cement my understanding of how functions work, and how the order of elements in a JS file will impact how the code is executed - something I didn't have to worry about as much in my previous experience with Python. 
Other than that, the thing I'm most proud of is the colour switcher, most other examples I saw from other people learning on the Odin Project had the grid clear when you changed the colour, or they had a rainbow effect for multicolour drawing, but mine allows you to switch colour without erasing what you've drawn, allowing the user to actually colour it and over-write the cells that have been previously coloured. I think that's pretty cool!

Enjoy, and thank you for looking!
